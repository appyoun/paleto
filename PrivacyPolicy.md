# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-31  
**App name:** Paleto  
**Contact:** appyoun@gmail.com

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the Paleto mobile application (the “Service”).

---

## 1. What we collect

### 1.1 Information you provide
- **Support inquiries:** If you contact us by email, we collect the information you include (e.g., email address, message contents) to respond.

### 1.2 Information collected automatically
Depending on your device and the Service configuration, we (and/or our service providers) may collect:
- **Device information:** device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone
- **Usage and diagnostics:** feature usage, crash logs, performance data
- **Identifiers:** advertising identifier and/or other device identifiers (used for ads, analytics, and fraud prevention)

> Note: We do not require account registration.

---

## 2. How we use information
We use collected information to:
- Provide and operate core features (e.g., detecting colors from photos/camera, saving palettes) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Improve app stability and performance (debugging, crash analysis)
- Show ads (free version) and measure ad performance
- Respond to support requests

---

## 3. Photos & Camera
Paleto can access:
- **Photos/Media Library** (to pick an image and extract colors)
- **Camera** (to capture an image and extract colors) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**How it works**
- Images are used to extract colors and create palettes.
- We do not require you to upload your photos to use color detection, unless a specific feature explicitly asks you to share/export.

You can disable these permissions anytime in your device settings, but some features may not work.

---

## 4. Sharing / Export
If you choose to share colors/palettes (e.g., via system share), the content is handled by the sharing app/service you choose, and their privacy policy applies.

---

## 5. Third-party services (Ads / Analytics)
The Service may use third-party SDKs for:
- Advertising (to show ads in the free version)
- Analytics and crash reporting

These providers may collect identifiers and usage/diagnostics data to provide their services.

**Examples (edit to match what you actually use):**
- Google AdMob (Advertising)
- Google Analytics for Firebase (Analytics)
- Firebase Crashlytics (Crash reporting)

> If you don’t use any of the above, remove them. If you use others, add them.

---

## 6. Data retention
- We retain automatically collected diagnostics/usage data only as long as needed for the purposes described above.
- Support emails are retained as long as necessary to respond and for record-keeping, unless you request deletion where applicable.

---

## 7. Your choices & rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, delete, or object to processing of your personal data.

You can also:
- Reset/limit the advertising identifier in your device settings
- Opt out of certain analytics where supported by your OS/app settings

To request deletion or inquire about your data, contact: **appyoun@gmail.com**

## 8. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

---

## 9. International data transfers (South Korea)
If you are located outside the **Republic of Korea (South Korea)** and choose to provide information to us, please note that we may transfer and process the data, including Personal Data, in the **Republic of Korea (South Korea)**.

---

## 10. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” at the top when changes are made.
